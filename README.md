                                        # Banking Loan Data Analytics & Strategic Dashboard
Project Overview
  - In this project, I acted as a Data Analyst to transform raw, fragmented banking transaction data into an automated, interactive reporting system. The goal was to provide stakeholders with a 360-degree view of financial performance, customer segmentation, and credit risk management.

I. Technical Workflow (3-Tier Architecture)
    - To ensure data integrity and scalability, I structured the workbook into three distinct layers:
        1. Source Data: Maintained raw datasets to ensure a "Single Source of Truth" and easy auditing.
        2.Format Data (ETL Layer): Leveraged Power Query and Advanced Formulas to clean, standardize date formats, and handle missing values.
        3.Design Dashboard (UI/UX): Developed an interactive reporting interface using Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Dynamic Charts, allowing users to filter data by Region, Timeframe, and Product Type with a single click.
    
II. Key Business Insights
    - Through data exploration, I identified several critical patterns:
      1. Customer Segmentation: Discovered that the "High-Net-Worth" segment (aged 30-45) contributes to 60% of total deposits, suggesting a need for tailored premium savings products.
      2. Regional Performance: Identified a 15% revenue gap between Northern and Southern branches, highlighting underperformance in specific loan products in the North.
      3. Risk Management: Implemented a real-time tracking system for Non-Performing Loans (NPL), enabling the credit department to issue early warnings for high-risk accounts.

III. Business Value & Impact
    - Efficiency: Automated 90% of the weekly reporting workflow, saving roughly 5-8 manual hours per week.
    - Data-Driven Decisions: Transformed static numbers into visual stories, enabling management to identify market trends and operational bottlenecks in under 5 minutes.
